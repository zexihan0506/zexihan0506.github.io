    <p>The Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS), an interdisciplinary program between the Khoury College of Computer and
    Information Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) in the College of Engineering,
    delivers a comprehensive framework for processing, modeling, analyzing, and reasoning about data.</p>
    
    <p>An extensive core curriculum—designed jointly by Khoury and ECE faculty—enables you to develop depth in computational
    modeling, data collection and integration, data storage and retrieval, data processing, modeling and analytics, and
    visualization. Plus, electives from Khoury, the College of Engineering, or a Northeastern partner college provide an
    opportunity to explore key contextual areas or more complex technical applications.</p>
